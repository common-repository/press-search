== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are stop words? =
Each document database is full of useless words. 
All the little words that appear in just about every document are completely useless for information retrieval purposes. 
Basically, their inverted document frequency is really low, so they never have much power in matching. 
Also, removing those words helps to make the index smaller and searching faster.
